# Basketball
This one of the projects I did during my undergraduate studies, in 2013.

## Project description
Informe.pdf (in Spanish)

(Brief summary in English below.)

For this project I decided to show how to generate bootable code and work with video mode, applying it in a simple game.

It is a game in which the objective is to score the ball. It has two levels. An arrow indicates the speed of the ball. You can adjust the angle (with 'a' and 'd') and the module (with '+' and '-', or with 'p' and 'm'), and to launch it just press the space bar.

The code is written in 16-bit NASM and works for the x86 architecture.

## Test
To test it, run ```make``` and then start the computer (or virtual machine) with the .img file in a pendrive.

It may run too fast in modern computers. It was originally tested in old computers in 2013.
